processingclock
===============

This is a calming clock written in processing.  It is more relaxing than helpful at telling the time (currently)

in order for this to work, the file needs to be put in a file called clock, because the original file is called clock.  Apparently the Processing IDE only will open this if the file name is the same name as the pde.

Don't say I didn't warn you.
